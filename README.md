bgg-json
========

This is a sample wrapper for the [BoardGameGeek JSON API](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2). It is developed in Javascript using NODEJS with EXPRESS to reexpose selected BGG API endpoints as JSON endpoints.

Note, this code is not intended to be comprehensive and lacks things that a production solution would need (e.g. throttling and caching).

This sample code is running live at [bgg-json-api.capi2.com.ar](http://bgg-json-api.capi2.com.ar/).
